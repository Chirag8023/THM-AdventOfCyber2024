      <h2>OPSEC ( Purple Teaming )</h2>
      We explored a YouTube-to-MP3 website which was installing malware to its users and analyzed the meta-data of the malware through which we backtracked to the attacker's actual identity.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Commands & Tools Used:</strong> Find, Exiftool, Github</li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2.</td>
    <td>
      <h2>Log Analysis ( Blue Teaming )</h2>
      We investigated security logs of a website, found patterns in the authentication, detected a brute force attack, and examined the encoded PowerShell command that had been run on the systems.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Commands & Tools Used:</strong> Elastic SIEM, CyberChef</li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3.</td>
    <td>
      <h2>Log Analysis ( Purple Teaming )</h2>
      This time, we used ELK to search through logs and found a specific IP that was using a web shell through a profile picture upload. In the second half, we logged into a website as admin because of weak/common credentials and tried to exploit an RCE via file upload.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Commands & Tools Used:</strong> ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana), ls, cat</li>
        <li><strong>Techniques Used:</strong> RCE (Remote Code Execution)</li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4.</td>
    <td>
      <h2>Atomic Red Team ( Purple Teaming )</h2>
      We recreated MITRE ATT&CK technique `T1566.001 Spearphishing` using the Atomic Red Team library, then in Windows Event Logs analyzed Sysmon logs confirming the compromise. Next, we tested technique `T1059.003 Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell`. After iterating through multiple tests, we found the one from which the machine was vulnerable.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Commands & Tools Used:</strong> Atomic Red Team Library, Sysmon, Windows Event Logs</li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5.</td>
    <td>
      <h2>XXE ( Red Teaming )</h2>
      We used `Burp Suite` to intercept requests and responses and tried to find out if the website is vulnerable to XXE (XML External Entity) Injection, then exploited it to get data only admins can access.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Commands & Tools Used:</strong> Burp Suite</li>
        <li><strong>Techniques Used:</strong> XXE (XML External Entity) Injection</li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6.</td>
    <td>
      <h2>Sandboxes ( Blue Teaming )</h2>
      We tested a malware in a virtual machine and detected it with `YARA rules`. After getting detected, we obscured it by using encoded commands, but it was still detectable by `floss` and `sysmon logs`.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Commands & Tools Used:</strong> YARA, Sysmon, CyberChef, FLOSS</li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7.</td>
    <td>
      <h2>AWS Log Analysis ( Blue Teaming )</h2>
      We went through Amazon CloudTrail and RDS logs using `jq` and `grep` to find out who was actually responsible for altering the QR code on the donation website.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Commands & Tools Used:</strong> JQ, grep</li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>8.</td>
    <td>
      <h2>Shellcodes ( Purple Teaming )</h2>
      Using `msfvenom`, we generated a shellcode, then tried to achieve a reverse shell by executing it on the target machine by loading it into memory.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Commands & Tools Used:</strong> msfvenom, nc</li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>9.</td>
    <td>
      <h2>GRC ( Blue Teaming )</h2>
      We performed a Risk Assessment based on the answers provided by different vendors to choose the one with the lowest risk.
      <hr>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>10.</td>
    <td>
      <h2>Phishing ( Red Teaming )</h2>
      We used `Metasploit Framework` to create a malicious macro and sent it through a similar-looking email. When the macro file was opened, we got access to the target system.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Commands & Tools Used:</strong> Metasploit Framework</li>
        <li><strong>Techniques Used:</strong> Typosquatting</li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
