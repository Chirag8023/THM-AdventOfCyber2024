        <td>
            <h2>OPSEC (Purple Teaming)</h2>
            We explored a YouTube-to-MP3 website which was installing malware to its users and analyzed the meta-data of the malware through that we backtrace to the attacker's actual identity.
            <br><strong>Commands & Tools Used:</strong> Find, Exiftool, Github.
        </td>

        <th>2.</th>
        <td>
            <h2>Log Analysis (Blue Teaming)</h2>
            We Investigated security logs of a website and found patterns in the authentication and detected a brute force attack, then examined the encoded powershell command that had been run on the systems.
            <br><strong>Commands & Tools Used:</strong> Elastic SIEM, CyberChef.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>3.</th>
        <td>
            <h2>Log Analysis (Purple Teaming)</h2>
            This time, we used ELK to search through logs and found a specific IP that was using a web shell through profile picture upload. In the second half, we logged into a website as admin due to weak/common credentials and tried to exploit an RCE via file upload.
            <br><strong>Commands & Tools Used:</strong> ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana), ls, cat.
            <br><strong>Techniques Used:</strong> RCE (Remote Code Execution).
        </td>
    </tr>

        <th>4.</th>
        <td>
            <h2>Atomic Red Team (Purple Teaming)</h2>
            We recreated MITRE ATT&CK technique `T1566.001 Spearphishing` using the Atomic Red Team library, then in Windows Event Logs analyzed Sysmon logs confirming the compromise.
            <br><strong>Commands & Tools Used:</strong> Atomic Red Team Library, Sysmon, Windows Event Logs.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>5.</th>
        <td>
            <h2>XXE (Red Teaming)</h2>
            We used Burp Suite to intercept request and response and tried to find if the website is vulnerable to XXE (XML external entity) Injection, then exploited it to get data only admins can access.
            <br><strong>Commands & Tools Used:</strong> Burp Suite.
            <br><strong>Techniques Used:</strong> XXE (XML External Entity Injection).
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>6.</th>
        <td>
            <h2>Sandboxes (Blue Teaming)</h2>
            We tested a malware in a virtual machine and detected it with YARA rules. After getting detected, we obscured it by using encoded commands, but it was still detectable by FLOSS and sysmon logs.
            <br><strong>Commands & Tools Used:</strong> YARA, Sysmon, CyberChef, FLOSS.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>7.</th>
        <td>
            <h2>AWS Log Analysis (Blue Teaming)</h2>
            We went through Amazon CloudTrail and RDS logs using jq and grep to find out who was responsible for altering the QR code on the donation website.
            <br><strong>Commands & Tools Used:</strong> jq, grep.
        </td>

    <tr>
        <th>8.</th>
        <td>
            <h2>Shellcodes (Purple Teaming)</h2>
            Using msfvenom, we generated a shellcode and tried to achieve a reverse shell by executing that on the target machine by loading it to memory.
            <br><strong>Commands & Tools Used:</strong> msfvenom, nc.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>9.</th>
        <td>
            <h2>GRC (Blue Teaming)</h2>
            We performed a Risk Assessment based on the questions answered by different vendors to choose the one with the lowest risk.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>10.</th>
        <td>
            <h2>Phishing (Red Teaming)</h2>
            We used Metasploit Framework to create a malicious macro and sent it through a similar-looking email. When the macro file opened, we gained access to the target system.
            <br><strong>Commands & Tools Used:</strong> Metasploit Framework.
            <br><strong>Techniques Used:</strong> Typosquatting.
        </td>

        <th>11.</th>
        <td>
            <h2>Wi-Fi Attacks (Red Teaming)</h2>
            We set our Wi-Fi into monitor mode using iw, then used airodump-ng to scan for nearby networks, sent deauth packets to a specific BSSID, captured the 4-way handshake, and performed a dictionary attack using aircrack-ng.
            <br><strong>Commands & Tools Used:</strong> iw, airodump-ng, aircrack-ng, aireplay-ng.
